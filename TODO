- Eliminate global variables where possible.

- Remove remaining non-glib linked list structures.  cf_list_t will
  likely be the most annoying.

- For functions returing ints to indicate success or failure, switch
  return type to gboolean and use TRUE and FALSE.

- Use glib types for common things, and glib functions where appropriate

- Clean up log messages on dhcp6r

- Fix RESOLV_CONF_DHCPV6_FILE and RESOLV_CONF_BAK_FILE so they use
  mkstemp() or something a little safer.

- Replace ioctl() calls with libnl calls if possible.

- Support a script-based configuration mode, similar to what dhclient does

- dhcp6c can pull an IA_NA and an IA_TA, but doesn't configure the interface
  with that information

- dhcp6c does not honor server preference on responses from servers

- Replace all .l files with a single lexer with multiple state paths depending
  on what we're reading.

- Improve config file formats

- Replace both .y files with a single parser with multiple state paths for
  the tokens we're parsing.

- Define all DHCPv6 options and states more clearly.  Fix up server component
  to handle all possible options.

- Support information refresh time option in client and server

- Support lease query in client and server

- Support IA_TA in the server

- Fix the log output

- Do not return NotOnLink for inforeq from client

- Do not trust the client with rapid-commit, if server conf does not have it,
  don't allow it

- dhcp6s does not work multiple relay servers, only one

- Support ddns updates in dhcp6c somehow (need to figure out how ddns works)

- valgrind and gcc -Wall checks
