- Update man pages

- Replace netlink.c with libnl

- Replace hash.c and TAILQ junk with glib

- Replace all .l files with a single lexer with multiple state paths depending
  on what we're reading.

- Replace both .y files with a single parser with multiple state paths for
  the tokens we're parsing.
