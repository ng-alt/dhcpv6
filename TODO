- dhcp6c can pull an IA_NA and an IA_TA, but doesn't configure the interface
  with that information

- Do all of the headers that get installed need to be installed?

- Do we need dad_token.l?  It reads /proc/net/if_inet6

- Can hash.c be replaced with a standard system offering?

- Update the README file and other documentation

- Update man pages

- Replace netlink.c with libnl
      get_if_rainfo
          calls libnl and adds to ralist in dhcp6_if
          calls libnl and sets ra_flag in dhcp6_if

- Replace all .l files with a single lexer with multiple state paths depending
  on what we're reading.

- Replace both .y files with a single parser with multiple state paths for
  the tokens we're parsing.

- Do we need radvd_token.l?  Why does dhcp6c modify radvd.conf?

- Clean up TRACE() messages, they are all over the place.

- Fix indentation.  Ugh, hate trailing whitespace and tabs.

- Define all DHCPv6 options and states more clearly.  Fix up server component
  to handle all possible options.

- Output timestamps using this format: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime

- Port to MacOS X
      - rm: conftest.dSYM is a directory
      - replacement for netlink calls
      - We should not have to pass -D_GNU_SOURCE
