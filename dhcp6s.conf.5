.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6s.conf
.Nd DHCPv6 server configuration file
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6s.conf
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains configuration information for KAME's DHCPv6 server,
.Nm dhcp6s .
The configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`;').
Statements are composed of tokens separated by white space,
which can be any combination of blanks,
tabs and newlines.
In some cases a set of statements is combined with a pair of brackets,
which is regarded as a single token.
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.Sh Interface specification
There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar fxp0
and
.Ar gif1.
.\"
.Sh Option statement
An option statement specifies configuration parameters provided for
every client.
The format of the statement is as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic option Ar option-name Op Ar option-value
;
.Xc
The following options can be specified in an option statement.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic domain-name-servers Ar dns-address Op Ar dns-addresses...
.Xc
provides DNS server address(es).
Each
.Ar dns-address
must be a numeric IPv6 address.
.El
.\"
.Sh Interface statement
An interface statement specifies configuration parameters on the
interface.
The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic interface Ar interface
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
The followings are possible
.Ar substatements
in an interface statement.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic allow Ar allow-options
;
.Xc
This statement specifies DHCPv6 options accepted by the server.
Currently only
.Ar rapid-commit
can be specified in an
.Ic allow
statement, which specifies the server to
accept a rapid-commit option in solicit messages.
.It Ic preference Ar pref ;
This statement sets the server's preference value on the
interface to the value
.Ar pref .
The specified value will be contained in a preference option of
advertise messages.
The preference value must be a decimal integer and be between 0 and
255 (inclusive.)
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Host statement
A host statement specifies configuration parameters for a particular
client.
The generic format of a host statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic host Ar name
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
.Ar name
is an arbitrary string.
It does not affect server's behavior but is provided for
readability of log messages.
Possible substatements are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic duid Ar ID
;
.Xc
This statement defines the client's DHCP unique identifier
.Pq DUID .
.Ar ID
is a colon-separated hexadecimal sequence where each separated part
must be composed of two hexadecimal values.
This statement is used to identify a particular host by the server
and must be included in a host statement.
.It Ic prefix Ar ipv6-prefix duration ;
This statement specifies an IPv6 prefix to be delegated to the client.
.Ar ipv6-prefix
is a string representing a valid IPv6 prefix
.Pq see the example below .
.Ar duration
is the lease duration of the prefix.
A positive decimal number or a special string
.Ic infinity
can be specified as
.Ar duration .
A decimal number provides the duration in seconds,
while
.Ic infinity
means the prefix never expires.
Multiple prefixes can be specified,
each of which is given by a single
.Ic prefix
statement.
In that case,
all of the specified prefixes will be delegated to the client.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Examples
The followings are a sample configuration to provide a DNS server
address for every client as well as to delegate an IPv6
prefix to a client whose DUID is 00:01:00:01:aa:bb.
.Bd -literal -offset
option domain-name-servers 3ffe:ffff::35;

host kame {
	duid 00:01:00:01:aa:bb;
	prefix 3ffe:ffff:1111::/48 infinity;
};

configuration file first appeared in the WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol
stack kit.
