.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6c.conf
.Nd DHCPv6 client configuration file
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6c.conf
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains configuration information for KAME's DHCPv6 client,
.Nm dhcp6c .
The configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`;').
Statements are composed of tokens separated by white space,
which can be any combination of blanks,
tabs and newlines.
In some cases a set of statements is combined with a pair of brackets,
which is regarded as a single token.
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.Sh Interface specification
There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar fxp0
and
.Ar gif1.
.\"
.Sh Interface statement
An interface statement specifies configuration parameters on the
interface.
The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic interface Ar interface
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
The followings are possible
.Ar substatements
in an interface statement.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic send Ar send-options
;
.Xc
This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be sent to the server(s).
Some options can only appear in particular messages according to the
specification,
in which case the appearance of the options is limited to be compliant
with the specification.
Currently only
.Ar rapid-commit
can be specified in a send statement, which specifies to include
a rapid-commit option in solicit messages.
.It Ic request Ar request-options ;
This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be included in an
option-request option.
Currently only
.Ar prefix-delegation
can be specified in a request statement, which requests the server to
delegate IPv6 prefixes.
.It Ic information-only ;
This statement specifies
.Nm dhcp6c
to only exchange informational configuration parameters with servers.
A list of DNS server addresses is an example of such parameters.
This statement is useful when the client does not need stateful
configuration parameters such as IPv6 addresses or prefixes.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Prefix interface statement
A prefix interface statement specifies configuration parameters of
prefixes on local interfaces that are derived from delegated prefixes.
The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic prefix-interface Ar interface
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
When an IPv6 prefix is delegated from a DHCPv6 server,
.Nm dhcp6c
will assign a prefix on the
.Ar interface
.Pq unless the interface received the DHCPv6 message containing the prefix
with the delegated prefix and the parameters provided in
.Ar substatements .
Possible substatements are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic sla-id Ar ID
;
.Xc
This statement specifies the identifier value of the site-level aggregator
.Pq SLA
on the interface.
.Ar ID
must be a decimal integer which fits in the length of SLA IDs
.Pq see below .
For example,
if
.Ar ID
is 1 and the client is delegated an IPv6 prefix 3ffe:ffff::/48,
.Nm dhcp6c
will combine the two values into a single IPv6 prefix,
3ffe:ffff:0:1::/64,
and will configure the prefix on the specified
.Ar interface .
.It Xo
.Ic sla-len Ar length
;
.Xc
This statement specifies the length of the SLA ID in bits.
.Ar length
must be a decimal number between 0 and 128.
If the length is not specified by this statement,
the default value 16 will be used.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Examples
The followings are a sample configuration to be delegated an IPv6
prefix from an upstream service provider.
With this configuration
.Nm dhcp6c
will send solicit messages containing a prefix delegation option in an
option request option on an upstream PPP link,
.Ar ppp0 .
After receiving some prefixes from a server,
.Nm dhcp6c
will then configure derived IPv6 prefixes with the SLA ID 1 on a
local ethernet interface,
.Ar ne0 .
.Bd -literal -offset
interface ppp0 {
        request prefix-delegation;
};

prefix-interface ne0 {
        sla-id 1;
};

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
configuration file first appeared in the WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol
stack kit.
