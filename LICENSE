The code in this project comes from a variety of sources.  Originally
starting as the KAME then WIDE dhcpv6 implementation, many companies
have contributed to what we have now.  The most recent contributions are
under the GPLv2 (or later) license, which means the entire project is
a derived work under the GPL.  The full text of the GPL version 2 is
available in the COPYING file in this same directory.  If you have questions,
feel free to contact me (David Cantrell <dcantrell@redhat.com>

The lists below note which license applies to each of the header and source
files in the distribution.
