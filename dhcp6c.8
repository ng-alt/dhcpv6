.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6c
.Nd DHCPv6 client daemon
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl Ddf
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
works as a DHCPv6 client and gets information from DHCPv6 servers
to configure the specified
.Ar interface .
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Use
.Ar configfile
as the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
.It Fl f
Foreground mode (useful when debugging).
Although
.Nm
usually prints warning, debugging, or error messages to
.Xr syslog 8 ,
it prints the messages to standard error if this option is
specified.
.El
.Pp
The program will daemonize itself on invocation unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.Pp
Upon receipt of the
.Dv SIGHUP
or
.Dv SIGTERM
signals,
.Nm
will release all stateful resources from the system.
In the former case the daemon will then stop running, while it will
reinvoke itself in the latter case.
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6c.conf -compact
.It Pa /var/run/dhcp6c.pid
contains pid of the currently running
.Nm dhcp6c .
.It Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/dhcp6c.conf
is the default configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/dhcp6c_duid
is the default file to store the client's DUID.

.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is incomplete and violates DHCPv6 protocol spec, in several aspects.
In particular, it does not handle address allocation via DHCPv6.
This is, however, rather intentional;
the authors believe stateless address autoconfiguration is enough for
IPv6 and will not implement the stateful method in the future.
