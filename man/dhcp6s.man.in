.SH NAME
dhcp6s \- DHCPv6 server daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcp6s
[
.B option...
]
.I <interface>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcp6s
is an implementation of the DHCPv6 server.

.B dhcp6s
provides IPv6 addresses and prefix assginment administrative policy and
configuration information for DHCPv6 clients. dhcp6s also manages those
addresses and prefixes, such as IPv6 addresses, prefixes, DNS server
addresses, or ntp server addresses.

Interface names are specified according to your operating system's
conventions.  On Linux, this is typically eth0, eth1, and so on.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c\ PATH,\ --conf-file=PATH
Specifies the
.B dhcp6s
configuration file.  The default is %DHCP6S_CONF_PATH%.

.TP
.B -p\ PATH,\ --pid-file=PATH
Specifies the
.B dhcp6s
PID file.  The default is %DHCP6C_PID_PATH%.

.TP
.B -l\ PATH,\ --lease-database=PATH
Specifies the location of the dhcp6s lease database.  The default is
%DHCP6S_LEASE_PATH%.

.TP
.B -i\ PATH,\ --duid-file=PATH
Specifies the location of the dhcp6s DUID file.  The default is
%DHCP6S_DUID_PATH%.

.TP
.B -f,\ --foreground
Run the client in the foreground.  All log messages will go to the console.

.TP
.B -v,\ --verbose
Enable verbose log output.

.TP
.B -d,\ --debug
Enable debugging log output (implies verbose log output).

.SH FILES

.B %DHCP6S_CONF_PATH%
Contains dhcp6s configurations, such as allow unicast, allow rapid-commit,
specify valid-life-time, or specify preferred-life-time.

.TP
.B %DHCP6S_PID_PATH%
Contains the dhcp6s process ID.

.TP
.B %DHCP6S_DUID_PATH%
Contains the dhcp6s server's DUID.

.TP
.B %DHCP6S_LEASE_PATH%
