.SH NAME
dhcp6c \- DHCPv6 client daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcp6c
[
.I options
]
.I <interface>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcp6c
is an implementation of the DHCPv6 client.

Using DHCPv6 messages and DHCPv6 options,
.B dhcp6c
is used to request and configure IPv6 addresses and host network configuration
information (e.g., DNS) for a network interface from the DHCPv6 server. It can
also be used as a requesting router to request and configure Prefix Delegation
for a subnet.

The assigned IPv6 addresses and prefixes are saved as
%DHCP6C_LEASE_PATH%; this file is used to request the same
addresses and prefixes from the DHCPv6 server.  Each
.B dhcp6c
client has a client DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID); the DUID file is saved as
%DHCP6C_DUID_PATH%.
The
.B dhcp6c
client configuration is defined in %DHCP6C_CONF_PATH%.

Interface names are specified according to your operating system's
conventions.  On Linux, this is typically eth0, eth1, and so on.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c\ PATH,\ --conf-file=PATH
Specifies the location of the configuration file for
.B dhcp6c.
The default is %DHCP6C_CONF_PATH%.

.TP
.B -p\ PATH,\ --pid-file=PATH
Specifies the location of the dhcp6c PID file.  The default is
%DHCP6C_PID_PATH%.

.TP
.B -r\ ['all'\ |\ ADDR...\],\ --release-address=['all'\ |\ ADDR...\]
Allows
.B dhcp6c
to release the addresses specified.
This option is used only when releasing addresses explicitly.

.TP
.B -R\ [ADDR...\],\ --request-named-address=[ADDR...\]
Allows
.B dhcp6c
to request the specified named addresses.

.TP
.B -P\ [ADDR...\],\ --request-prefix-delegation=[ADDR...\]
Allows
.B dhcp6c
to request the specified prefix delegation addresses.

.TP
.B -I,\ --request-info-only
Allows
.B dhcp6c
to request network information only.  Do not configure the interface.

.TP
.B -s\ PATH,\ --script=PATH
Specifies an executable script or program to execute on dhcp6c state changes.
If provided, this file must handle all DHCPv6 client states, handle interface
configuration, and handle DHCPv6 options.  The default is for dhcp6c to
handle all state changes and interface configuration internally.

.TP
.B -l\ PATH,\ --lease-database=PATH
Specifies the location of the dhcp6c lease database.  The default is
%DHCP6C_LEASE_PATH%.

.TP
.B -i\ PATH,\ --duid-file=PATH
Specifies the location of the dhcp6c DUID file.  The default is
%DHCP6C_DUID_PATH%.

.TP
.B -f,\ --foreground
Run the client in the foreground.  All log messages will go to the console.

.TP
.B -v,\ --verbose
Enable verbose log output.

.TP
.B -d,\ --debug
Enable debugging log output (implies verbose log output).

.SH FILES
.TP
.B %DHCP6C_CONF_PATH%
Contains DHCPv6 client configuration information.

.TP
.B %DHCP6C_PID_PATH%
Contains the dhcp6c process ID.

.TP
.B %DHCP6C_LEASE_PATH%
Contains DHCPv6 client assigned IPv6 addresses and prefixes.

.TP
.B %DHCP6C_DUID_PATH%
Contains DHCPv6 client DUID.

.SH ERRORS
Check /var/log/messages if there are errors.
