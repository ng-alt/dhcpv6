.SH NAME
dhcp6r \- DHCPv6 relay agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcp6r
[
.B options...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcp6r
acts as DHCPv6 relay agent forwarding DHCPv6 messages from clients to servers
and vice versa.  DHCPv6 messages from clients are received at UDP port 547,
they are forwarded to one or more DHCPv6 servers by multicast and/or unicast.
DHCPv6 messages from servers to clients are also received at UDP port 547 and
forwarded by unicast only.
.PP
DHCPv6 messages received by multicast at a certain IPv6 interface are never
forwarded by multicast to the same interface.
.PP
If no options are present, the relay agent receives messages by unicast and
multicast at all IPv6 interfaces, and all messages are forwarded to all IPv6
interfaces by multicast with the exception mentioned in the previous paragraph.
.PP
If one or more
.I client-options
are present, then messages are only received as specified by the client
options.  If one or more
.I server-options
are present, then messages are only forwarded as specified by the server
options.

.SH CLIENT OPTIONS
If no client options are present, the relay receives messages by multicast
and unicast at all IPv6 interfaces.
.PP
If one or more client options are present, then messages are only received as
specified by the client options.
.PP
In any case, the relay receives client messages by unicast.
.TP
.B -c,\ --client-unicast
This option can be used to configure the client such that it receives messages
from clients or other relay agents by unicast only.  It does not have any
effect if a
.B \-C
option is present.
.TP
.B -C\ INTERFACE...,\ --client-multicast=INTERFACE...
Accept client messages multicasted at IPv6 interface
.IR INTERFACE .
The others are receiving only unicast messages. For specifying a set of
interfaces, enclose the list in quote marks and separate the interface
names by spaces (e.g., "eth0 eth1 eth2").

.SH SERVER OPTIONS
If no server options are present, the relay forwards messages received from
clients by multicast and unicast to all IPv6 interfaces, except the one, which
the packet was received on.
.PP
If one or more server options are present, then messages are forwarded as
specified by the server options.
.TP
.B -S\ INTERFACE...,\ --server-multicast=INTERFACE...
Forward all received client messages by multicast at IPv6 interface
.IR INTERFACE .
For specifying a set of interfaces, enclose the list in quote marks and
separate the interface names by spaces (e.g., "eth0 eth1 eth2").
.TP
.B -s\ ADDRESS...,\ --server-unicast=ADDRESS...
Forward all received client messages by unicast to the IPv6 address
.IR ADDRESS .
For specifying a set of addresses, enclose the addresses in quote
marks and separate the addresses by spaces.
.TP
.B -F\ INTERFACE+ADDRESS...,\ --forward=INTERFACE+ADDRESS...
Forward all received client messages by unicast to the IPv6 address
.I ADDRESS
through the IPv6 interface
.IR INTERFACE .
For specifying a set of combinations of interfaces and addresses, enclose the
interface+address pairs in quote marks and separate each pair by
spaces.
.PP
The 
.BR -S ,
.BR -s ,
and 
.B -F 
options can be combined in arbitrary ways.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.TP
.B -p\ PATH,\ --pid-file=PATH
Specifies the location of the dhcp6r PID file.  The default is
%DHCP6R_PID_PATH%.
.TP
.B -f,\ --foreground
Run the client in the foreground.  All log messages will go to the console.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples are shown as given to the shell:
.TP
.SH dhcp6r
Receive messages from clients at all IPv6 interfaces by multicast and by
unicast, and forward them to all (other) IPv6 interfaces by multicast.
.TP
.SH dhcp6r -c
Receive messages from clients by unicast only, and forward them to all (other)
IPv6 interfaces by multicast.
.TP
.SH dhcp6r -C 'eth0 eth2'
Receive messages from clients at interfaces eth0 and eth2 by multicast and by
unicast, and forward them to all IPv6 interfaces by multicast (except the one
at which the message was received by multicast).
.TP
.SH dhcp6r -C 'eth0 eth2' -S eth1
Receive messages from clients at interfaces eth0 and eth2 by multicast and by
unicast, and forward them to interfaces eth1 by multicast.
.TP
.nf
.SH dhcp6r -s 'fec0::204:ce33:763f:b34 fec0::504:ff33:73f:c557'
.fi
Receive messages from clients at all IPv6 interfaces by multicast and by
unicast, and forward a copy of them to each of the specified addresses.
.TP
.SH dhcp6r -S eth1 -s fec0::204:ce33:763f:b34
Receive messages from clients at all IPv6 interfaces by multicast and by
unicast, and forward them to interface eth1 by multicast and to the specified
unicast address.
.TP
.SH dhcp6r -S eth1 -F eth0+fec0::504:ff33:73f:c557
Receive messages from clients at all IPv6 interfaces by multicast and by
unicast, and forward them to interface eth1 by multicast and to the specified
unicast address.  For the unicast address it is enforced that the message
will be sent through interface eth0.

.SH NOTES
For proper operation of dhcp6r, the host must have at least one global/site
scope address assigned to each interface.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B %DHCP6R_PID_PATH%
Contains the dhcp6r process ID.
